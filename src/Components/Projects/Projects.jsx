    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      My passion for Software engineering pushes me to be innovative with
      cutting-edge technology. As a software engineer, I see the development
      process as an ongoing journeyâ€”one that thrives on continuous growth and
      adaptation. Every project is an opportunity to push boundaries and shape
      technology that evolves with the future.
